 * XCreatePixmapFromBitmapData: Routine to make a pixmap from user supplied bitmap data.
 *             D is any drawable on the same screen that the pixmap will be used in.
 *             Data is a pointer to the bit data, and 
 *             width & height give the size in bits of the pixmap.
 *             Fg and Bg are the pixel values to use for the two colors.
 *             Depth is the depth of the pixmap to create.
 *
 * The following format is assumed for data:
 *
 *    format=XYPixmap
 *    bit_order=LSBFirst
 *    byte_order=LSBFirst
 *    padding=8
 *    bitmap_unit=8
 *    xoffset=0
 *    no extra bytes per line
